*Declarative:
In computer science, declarative programming is a
programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer
programs that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control
flow. 

*Functional Programming: 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we 
try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style.
It is a declarative type of programming style.

*DataFlow: 
In computer programming, dataflow programming is a paradigm that models a 
program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing 
dataflow principles and architecture.
 
*Functional (declarative): 
Physicists, mathematicians, and chemists think in terms of equations and functions, they define solutions to     problems as answers to equations and functions. The functional paradigm works this way: you program an answer to a problem with           equational functions that read an input and calculate an output. ``Variables'' are like the ones in algebra, not like the ones in         Fortran or C.
 
*Logic:
Logic programming is a computer programming paradigm in which program statements express facts and rules about problems within a system of formal logic. Rules are written as logical clauses with a head and a body; for instance, "H is true if B1, B2, and B3 are true." Facts are expressed similar to rules, but without a body; for instance, "H is true."  Some logic programming languages, such as Datalog and ASP (Answer Set Programming), are purely declarative. They allow for statements about what the program should accomplish, with no explicit step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Others, such as Prolog, are a combination of declarative and imperative. They may also include procedural statements, such as "To solve H, solve B1, B2, and B3."

*Constraint-based:
Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, operations research, algorithms, graph theory and elsewhere. The basic idea in constraint programming is that the user states the constraints and a general purpose constraint solver is used to solve them.
Constraints are just relations, and a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) states which relations should hold among the given decision variables. More formally, a constraint satisfaction problem consists of a set of variables, each with some domain of values, and a set of relations on subsets of these variables.

*Template-based:
Templates are the foundation of generic programming, which involves writing code in a way that is independent of any particular type.
A template is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or a function. The library containers like iterators and algorithms are examples of generic programming and have been developed using template concept.

*Programming language a program intended for the construction of other computer programs. Its name is due to the fact that it comprises a formal language that is designed to organize algorithms and logical processes that will then be carried out by a computer or computer system, thus controlling its physical and logical behavior and its communication with the human user.
This language is made up of symbols and syntactic and semantic rules, expressed in the form of instructions and logical relationships, by means of which the source code of a specific application or piece of software is constructed. Thus, the end result of these creative processes can also be called the programming language.
Sequential algorithm

*The sequential structure is one in which one action (instruction) follows another in sequence. The tasks follow each other in such a way that the output of one is the input of the next and so on until the end of the process.
*Structured:
Structured programming is a program written with only the structured programming constructions:  Sequence: Lines or blocks of code are written and executed in sequential order. Repetition: Repeat a block of code (Action) while a condition is true. There is no limit to the number of times that the block can be executed. Selection: Execute a block of code (Action) if a condition is true. The block of code is executed at most once. 
Some characteristics are: The code should be in modular nature, there should be single entry and single exit for each module (i.e. no unconditional gates). At least one construct each for sequence, condition and iteration.

*Imperative: 
Imperative programming is a paradigm of computer programming in which the program describes a sequence of steps that change the state of the computer. Unlike declarative programming, which describes "what" a program should accomplish, imperative programming explicitly tells the computer "how" to accomplish it. Programs written this way often compile to binary executables that run more efficiently since all CPU instructions are themselves imperative statements.
To make programs simpler for a human to read and write, imperative statements can be grouped into sections known as code blocks.
In the 1950s, the idea of grouping a program's code into blocks was first implemented in the ALGOL programming language. They were originally called "compound statements," but today these blocks of code are known as procedures. Once a procedure is defined, it can be used as a single imperative statement, abstracting the control flow of a program and allowing the developer to express programming ideas more naturally. This type of imperative programming is called procedural programming, and it is a step towards higher-level abstractions such as declarative programming.

*Von Neumann: 
A von Neumann language is any of those programming languages that are high-level abstract isomorphic copies of von Neumann architectures. As of 2009, most current programming languages fit into this.

*Interpreted (Scripting):  In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code.
Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. Here, if the author decides he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, he could scratch the old one out and add the new one. Your translator friend can then convey that change to you as it happens.
Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.
Examples of common interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

*Object-oriented	
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based upon objects (having both data and methods) that aims to incorporate the advantages of modularity and reusability. Objects, which are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and computer programs.
The important features of object–oriented programming are:
	•Bottom–up approach in program design
	•Programs organized around objects, grouped in classes
	•Focus on data with methods to operate upon object’s data
	•Interaction between objects through functions
	•Reusability of design through creation of new classes by adding features to existing classes

*Some examples of object-oriented programming languages are C++, Java, Smalltalk, Delphi, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby, and PHP.

*Identify basic functions of input-output (I/O) in structured programming language.
Input means to provide the program with some data to be used in the program and Output means to display data on screen or write the data to a printer or a file.
C programming language provides many built-in functions to read any given input and to display data on screen when there is a need to output the result. "Such as scanf() and printf() functions"

*Identify the operators of structured programming language (Relational/Conditional/Logical): 
Here, we used a symbol > and it is called a relational operator and in their simplest form, they produce Boolean results which means the result will be either true or false. Similarly, a programming language provides various relational operators. The following table lists down a few of the important relational operators available in C programming language. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Operator	                                Description	                                         Example
==	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A == B) is not true.
!=	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.	(A != B) is true.
>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A > B) is not true.
<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A < B) is true.
>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A >= B) is not true.
<=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A <= B) is true.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Here, we will show you one example of C Programming which makes use of if conditional statement. Though this statement will be discussed later in a separate chapter, but in short, we use if statement to check a condition and if the condition is true, then the body of if statement is executed, otherwise the body of if statement is skipped.
  -If 
  -Else 

*Logical Operators:
Logical operators are very important in any programming language and they help us take decisions based on certain conditions. Suppose we want to combine the result of two conditions, then logical AND and OR logical operators help us in producing the final result.
The following table shows all the logical operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Operator	                                      Description	                                        Example
-&&	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.	(A && B) is false.
-||	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.	(A || B) is true.
-!	Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.	!(A && B) is true.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Compiled Languages:
Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.
Compiled languages need a “build” step – they need to be manually compiled first. You need to “rebuild” the program every time you need to make a change. In our hummus example, the entire translation is written before it gets to you. If the original author decides that he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, the entire recipe would need to be translated again and resent to you.
   -Examples of pure compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go.

*Interpreted Languages
Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. Here, if the author decides he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, he could scratch the old one out and add the new one. Your translator friend can then convey that change to you as it happens.
Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.
    -Examples of common interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

*Source Code: 
Source code is the fundamental component of a computer program that is created by a programmer. It can be read and easily understood by a human being. When a programmer types a sequence of C programming language statements into Windows Notepad, for example, and saves the sequence as a text file, the text file is said to contain the source code.

*C Programming Reserved Keywords
Often found in programming languages and macros, reserved words are terms or phrases appropriated for special use that may not be utilized in the creation of variable names. For example, "print" is a reserved word because it is a function in many languages to show text on the screen.
Here is a table having almost all the keywords supported by C Programming language −
--------------------------------------------
-auto	else	long	switch
-break	enum	register	typedef
-case	extern	return	union
-char	float	short	unsigned
-const	for	signed	void
-continue	Goto	Sizeof	volatile
-default	if	static	while
-do	int	struct	_Packed
-double			
--------------------------------------------

*Identifiers:
What are Identifiers?
In C language identifiers are the names given to variables, constants, functions and user-define data. These identifiers are defined against a set of rules.
Rules for an Identifier
1.	An Identifier can only have alphanumeric characters (a-z , A-Z , 0-9) and underscore(_).
2.	The first character of an identifier can only contain alphabet (a-z , A-Z) or underscore (_).
3.	Identifiers are also case sensitive in C. For example, name and Name are two different identifiers in C.
4.	Keywords are not allowed to be used as Identifiers.
5.	No special characters, such as semicolon, period, whitespaces, slash or comma are permitted to be used in or as Identifier.

When we declare a variable or any function in C language program, to use it we must provide a name to it, which identified it throughout the program, for example:
int myvariable ="Studytonight";
Here myvariable is the name or identifier for the variable which stores the value "Studytonight" in it.
Constant: is a data item whose value cannot change during the program’s execution. Thus, as its name implies – the value is constant.
Variable: is a data item whose value can change during the program’s execution. Thus, as its name implies – the value can vary.
Constants are used in two ways. They are:
1.	literal constant
2.	defined constant
A literal constant is a value you type into your program wherever it is needed. Examples include the constants used for initializing a variable and constants used in lines of code 


*Data types: 
Data types specify how we enter data into our programs and what type of data we enter. Language has some predefined set of data types to handle various kinds of data that we can use in our program. These datatypes have different storage capacities.
A language supports 2 different type of data types:
1.	Primary data types:
These are fundamental data types in C namely integer(int), floating point(float), character(char) and void.
2.	Derived data types:
Derived data types are nothing but primary datatypes but a little twisted or grouped together like array, structure, union and pointer. These are discussed in details later.
Data type determines the type of data a variable will hold. If a variable x is declared as int. it means x can hold only integer values. Every variable which is used in the program must be declared as what data-type it is.
 
*Integer type
Integers are used to store whole numbers.
Size and range of Integer type on 16-bit machine:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Type	Size(bytes)	Range
-int or signed int	2	-32,768 to 32767
-unsigned int	2	0 to 65535
-short int or signed short int	1	-128 to 127
-unsigned short int	1	0 to 255
-long int or signed long int	4	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
-unsigned long int	4	0 to 4,294,967,295

-unsigned char	1	0 to 255
_________________________________________________________________________
*Void type
void type means no value. This is usually used to specify the type of functions which returns nothing. We will get acquainted to this datatype as we start learning more advanced topics in a language, like functions, pointers etc.
